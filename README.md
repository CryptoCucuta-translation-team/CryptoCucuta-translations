# CryptoCucuta-translations

# How to submit a document to translate?

1. Go to the folder `Submissions/`
2. Click `Create new file` or `Upload files` and add your document that you want translated.
3. You can add comments in the top of the document, or in the pull request specifying requests. For example, what tone is intended, the context of the text, etc.
4. Then click `commit changes` and write your commit request.
5. When the document is translated, it will be available in the folder `Translations`. It will have the `_traduccion` text added to the name.


# How to submit a translation?

**The documents that are not yet translated will appear as "Pull requests".**

A translator can simply go to one of those pull requests. And you will see a tab that says "Files Changed"

1. Inside there, you will find in green the added text to be translated. It will be named, for example, `Submissions/filename.txt`.
2. You can start working on your translation. When you are ready to submit (partial or full submission), make sure that  you submit by adding a commit to that pull-request with the translated file as `Translations/filename_traduccion.txt`. And commit the file. **Make sure your translation has the same name**
3. Submissions must be reviewed by at least one other person. Therefore, if a text has already been translated, you can still help by reviewing the translation. If you see any errors, you can submit your edits and commit as well. 
4. Add any comments you may have on the pull request.


## FAQ

This FAQ will explain some basic concepts on github

### Do I have to download any software to use github?

No, you can work directly on the browser! However, using a desktop app will make things easier, since you can then simply navigate files and folders in your own computer, without having to navigate through a browser. 

### How to add a commit in a pull request in github? 


Adding a commit means that you are adding a new file, or modifying an existing file, inside that pull request.


To add a file to a pull request, you first **must be in the branch that corresponds to that pull-request**. 
You see which branch you are on because it says on the code window "`Branch: name of branch`"

- If you are adding a file, once you are in the correct branch, browse the folders, click the "Create new file", and add the file there. You must provide a file name, a description, and you must "commit files to branch `name of branch`" (Or as a pull-request if it doesn't allow you to commit directly).

- If you are editing a file, click on the file that you want to edit, then click the pencil symbol on the top right to edit the file. After you make your changes, you must provide a description of your changes and click on "commit files to branch `name of branch`". (Or as a pull-request if it doesn't allow you to commit directly).

### How do I get to the correct branch of the pull request?

- To get to the correct branch, if you are looking at the Pull Request. Go to the "`Files Changed`" window. Then, click the "`View`" button on one of the files. That will take you to the file, on the branch that it was found. 
- Alternatively, if you are looking at the `<> Code` view. You can click on where it says `Branch: name`. Click there, and a drop-down menu will appear that will show you all available branches. Search there for the branch you are trying to find.
